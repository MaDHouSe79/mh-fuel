# MH Fuel for QB-Core - (OneSync Required) (BETA Version)
- A fuel script with a fuel station as job and shop build in that sync fuel between all players.

# Company vehicles
- if a vehicle class is an Emergency class 18 vehicle, this fuel will be paid by the company.
- you can also add more company vehicles in the config `Config.JobFuelPaidByCompany` table.
- With this people don't have to pay from there own money.

# Owned Fuel Stations
- You can use owned fuel stations, but you can also use the fuel system only and not the owned fuel stations.
- Don't forget to add the database or the station job does not work.
- You need to change `Config.StationsCanBeOwnedByPlayers` from `false` to `true`.

# Shop Items
- You need to add the item in de `server/stations.lua` file in the `ShopItems` table at line 4.
- when you add new items you need to set `SV_Config.RunDatabaseBackupLoader` from `false` to `true` 
- when you start the server or script, after that you need to set `SV_Config.RunDatabaseBackupLoader` to `false` again.
- This will reset the database gasstations and items.
